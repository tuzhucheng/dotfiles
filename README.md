Configurations
--------------

This repository is used to store all my configuration files so I can quickly get my environment up and running when I set-up new machines (e.g. .vimrc, .conf, etc.).

How to use
==========

### Shell

Currently only have configuration for bash. Will add zsh configs in the future.

Source `source_all.sh` from `.bash_profile`, etc..
